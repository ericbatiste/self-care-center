# Self-Care Center 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
Self Care Center is a fun little app to give you some positive encouragement and direction as often as you choose to use it.  Simply select the type of message you would like to receive (affirmation or mantra) then click the 'receive messag' button and the app will display a random message from the corresponding messages array.  Additionally, the user can navigate to a 'view all messages' page where they can see all saved messages, add new ones as well as remove old ones.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
This is our second solo project about halfway though Mod 1 of the Turing program. I'd say I spent about eight to ten hours total working on this project of the course of a few days. We were givin about five days to complete the assignment.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
For this project I was tasked with building out the entire comp and adding functionality from scratch. Languages used are HTML, CSS and Javascript.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
Setting up the 'All message interface' was probably the biggest win, it turned out to be a bit more code than I had anticipated. Getting to throw in some transitions and hover features to give the user proper feedback when using the site was fun as well. As far as challenges go, there are a couple functions that I still want to refactor and combine, for example, the delete message functions, to make one dynamic function. The issue that I was running into was once I introduced parameters, when the function was called in the event listener, the array being as an argument was returning undefined. I will definitely update once I figure out whats going on here.
